## Parents

 *  is_a: [EnvironmentalExposure](EnvironmentalExposure.md) - A environmental exposure is a factor relating to abiotic processes in the environment including sunlight (UV-B), atmospheric (heat, cold, general pollution) and water-born contaminants.

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [ExposureEvent](ExposureEvent.md) - A (possibly time bounded) incidence of a feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes

## Attributes


### Inherited from association:

 * [subject](subject.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
     * Range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [predicate](predicate.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
