# Slot: qualified predicate


Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a  full statement reading.
