## Mixin for

 * [GeneToGeneCoexpressionAssociation](GeneToGeneCoexpressionAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Indicates that two genes are co-expressed, generally under the same conditions.
 * [VariantToGeneExpressionAssociation](VariantToGeneExpressionAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a variant and expression of a gene (i.e. e-QTL)

## Attributes


### Own

 * [expression site](expression_site.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: location in which gene or protein expression takes place. May be cell, tissue, or organ.
     * Range: [AnatomicalEntity](AnatomicalEntity.md)
     * Example: UBERON:0002037 cerebellum
 * [quantifier qualifier](quantifier_qualifier.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A measurable quantity for the object of the association
     * Range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
 * [phenotypic state](phenotypic_state.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: in experiments (e.g. gene expression) assaying diseased or unhealthy tissue, the phenotypic state can be put here, e.g. MONDO ID. For healthy tissues, use XXX.
     * Range: [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md)

### Inherited from gene to expression site association:

 * [stage qualifier](stage_qualifier.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: stage during which gene or protein expression of takes place.
     * Range: [LifeStage](LifeStage.md)
     * Example: UBERON:0000069 larval stage
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [quantifier qualifier](quantifier_qualifier.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A measurable quantity for the object of the association
     * Range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
 * [subject](subject.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
     * Range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
     * Range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [predicate](predicate.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.
     * Range: [PredicateType](types/PredicateType.md)

### Domain for slot:

 * [quantifier qualifier](quantifier_qualifier.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A measurable quantity for the object of the association
     * Range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
