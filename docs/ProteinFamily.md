## Parents

 *  is_a: [BiologicalEntity](BiologicalEntity.md)

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [GeneGroupingMixin](GeneGroupingMixin.md) - any grouping of multiple genes or gene products
 *  mixin: [ChemicalEntityOrGeneOrGeneProduct](ChemicalEntityOrGeneOrGeneProduct.md) - A union of chemical entities and children, and gene or gene product. This mixin is helpful to use when searching across chemical entities that must include genes and their children as chemical entities.

## Attributes


### Inherited from entity:

 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
     * Range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}
     * Range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
     * Range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from gene grouping mixin:

 * [has gene or gene product](has_gene_or_gene_product.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects an entity with one or more gene or gene products
     * Range: [Gene](Gene.md)

### Inherited from gene product mixin:

 * [xref](xref.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing or edge between two  NamedThings.  This property should point to a database record or webpage that supports the existence of the edge, or  gives more detail about the edge. This property can be used on a node or edge to provide multiple URIs or CURIE cross references.
     * Range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from information resource:

 * [information resource status](information_resource_status.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: the status of the infores identifier, default is released
     * Range: [InformationResourceStatusEnum](InformationResourceStatusEnum.md)
 * [id](id.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
     * Range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from macromolecular machine mixin:

 * [name](name.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.
     * Range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...

Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}
     * Range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from thing with taxon:

 * [in taxon](in_taxon.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects an entity to its taxonomic classification. Only certain kinds of entities can be taxonomically classified; see 'thing with taxon'
     * Range: [OrganismTaxon](OrganismTaxon.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
