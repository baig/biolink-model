# Class: InformationResource


A database or knowledgebase and its supporting ecosystem of interfaces  and services that deliver content to consumers (e.g. web portals, APIs,  query endpoints, streaming services, data downloads, etc.). A single Information Resource by this definition may span many different datasets or databases, and include many access endpoints and user interfaces. Information Resources include project-specific resources such as a Translator Knowledge Provider, and community knowledgebases like ChemBL, OMIM, or DGIdb.

## Attributes


### Own

 * [description](description.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
     * Range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [id](id.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [information resource status](information_resource_status.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: the status of the infores identifier, default is released
     * Range: [InformationResourceStatusEnum](InformationResourceStatusEnum.md)

### Inherited from entity:

 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
     * Range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}
     * Range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
     * Range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from gene product mixin:

 * [xref](xref.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing or edge between two  NamedThings.  This property should point to a database record or webpage that supports the existence of the edge, or  gives more detail about the edge. This property can be used on a node or edge to provide multiple URIs or CURIE cross references.
     * Range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from information content entity:

 * [license](license.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [rights](rights.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [format](format.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [creation date](creation_date.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: date on which an entity was created. This can be applied to nodes or edges
     * Range: [Date](types/Date.md)

### Inherited from macromolecular machine mixin:

 * [name](name.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.
     * Range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
