### Classes

 * [ChemicalEntity](ChemicalEntity.md) - A chemical entity is a physical entity that pertains to chemistry or biochemistry.
 * [ChemicalMixture](ChemicalMixture.md) - A chemical mixture is a chemical entity composed of two or more molecular entities.
 * [ComplexMolecularMixture](ComplexMolecularMixture.md) - A complex molecular mixture is a chemical mixture composed of two or more molecular entities with unknown concentration and stoichiometry.
 * [Disease](Disease.md) - A disorder of structure or function, especially one that produces specific  signs, phenotypes or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a  direct result of physical injury.  A disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an  organism because of one or more disorders in that organism.
 * [Gene](Gene.md) - A region (or regions) that includes all of the sequence elements necessary to encode a functional transcript. A gene locus may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions.
 * [InformationResource](InformationResource.md) - A database or knowledgebase and its supporting ecosystem of interfaces  and services that deliver content to consumers (e.g. web portals, APIs,  query endpoints, streaming services, data downloads, etc.). A single Information Resource by this definition may span many different datasets or databases, and include many access endpoints and user interfaces. Information Resources include project-specific resources such as a Translator Knowledge Provider, and community knowledgebases like ChemBL, OMIM, or DGIdb.
 * [MolecularEntity](MolecularEntity.md) - A molecular entity is a chemical entity composed of individual or covalently bonded atoms.
 * [MolecularMixture](MolecularMixture.md) - A molecular mixture is a chemical mixture composed of two or more molecular entities with known concentration and stoichiometry.
 * [NucleicAcidEntity](NucleicAcidEntity.md) - A nucleic acid entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in gene databases of nucleotide-based sequence representations of its precise sequence; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included.
 * [SmallMolecule](SmallMolecule.md) - A small molecule entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in small-molecule databases of SMILES, InChI, IUPAC, or other unambiguous representation of its precise chemical structure; for convenience of representation, any valid chemical representation is included, even if it is not strictly molecular (e.g., sodium ion).
