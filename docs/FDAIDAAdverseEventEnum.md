| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| life_threatening_adverse_event | An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'life-threatening' if, in the view of either  the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more  severe form, might have caused death. |  |  |
| serious_adverse_event | An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'serious' if, in the view of either the  investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth  defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or  subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient  hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. |  |  |
| suspected_adverse_reaction | means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 'reasonable possibility' means there is evidence to suggest a  causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser  degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. |  |  |
| unexpected_adverse_event | An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'unexpected' if it is not listed in the  investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an  investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described  in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the  investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the  investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 'Unexpected', as used in this definition,  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but  are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. |  |  |
