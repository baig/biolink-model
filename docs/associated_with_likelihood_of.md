# Relation: associated_with_likelihood_of


A a relationship that holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical  dependence is demonstrated, wherein the state or value of one variable predicts the future state  or value of the other.  E.g. the statement “An Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) diagnosis is associated  with likelihood of a Myocardial Infraction (MI) diagnosis” asserts that the state of having Afib  is associated with an increased or decreased likelihood that a patient will later exhibit MI.
