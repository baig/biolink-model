## Parents

 *  is_a: [ChemicalEntityToEntityAssociationMixin](ChemicalEntityToEntityAssociationMixin.md) - An interaction between a chemical entity and another entity

## Mixin for

 * [ChemicalGeneInteractionAssociation](ChemicalGeneInteractionAssociation.md) (mixin)  - describes a physical interaction between a chemical entity and a gene or gene product. Any biological or chemical effect resulting from such an interaction are out of scope, and covered by the ChemicalAffectsGeneAssociation type (e.g. impact of a chemical on the abundance, activity, structure, etc, of either participant in the interaction)
 * [ChemicalOrDrugOrTreatmentSideEffectDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](ChemicalOrDrugOrTreatmentSideEffectDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - This association defines a relationship between a chemical or treatment (or procedure) and a disease or phenotypic feature where the disesae or phenotypic feature is a secondary, typically (but not always) undesirable effect.
 * [ChemicalOrDrugOrTreatmentToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](ChemicalOrDrugOrTreatmentToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - This association defines a relationship between a chemical or treatment (or procedure) and a disease or phenotypic feature where the disesae or phenotypic feature is a secondary undesirable effect.
 * [ChemicalToChemicalAssociation](ChemicalToChemicalAssociation.md) (mixin)  - A relationship between two chemical entities. This can encompass actual interactions as well as temporal causal edges, e.g. one chemical converted to another.
 * [ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An interaction between a chemical entity and a phenotype or disease, where the presence of the chemical gives rise to or exacerbates the phenotype.
 * [ChemicalToPathwayAssociation](ChemicalToPathwayAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An interaction between a chemical entity and a biological process or pathway.
